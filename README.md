Homework 1 

This is my homework submission for week 1

For this assignment I was tasked with making a website more accessible. 

This was the criteria for the assignment:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Changes made to HTML to meet criteria:
Added semantic elements
Separated the elements in the webpage for easier editing and 
Added alt attributes for the images
Added logical structure for the headings
Added a concise, descriptive title
Cleaned CSS
